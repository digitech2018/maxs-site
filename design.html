I researched to find a 3D modelling soft where that was not only easy to use but also could produce a professional result that could be assessed. I found what I was looking for in a 3D modelling soft where called Magica Voxel which is a 3D modelling app that allows the user to model and animate objects and then render them to create professional 3D models.

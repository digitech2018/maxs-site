<center> <p><font color="black"><font size="3"> To build a racing drone you first need to select the components you want to use. You must choose carefully as not all components work together well, for example if you pug a five-cell battery in to a board that can only take the voltage of a four cell then you will have a big fire this has happened to me many times.
the drone consists of these components that you will have to solder and put together.
flight controller (FC) 
ESC’s (electric speed controllers)
motors 
frame 
camera 
VTX (video transmitter) 
receiver
antenna 
depending on how well u select your parts and how skilfully you put them together is how well and fast your quad will fly. My fastest quad has reached over 100kph in a straight line and it was very very  loud!

<center> <p><font color="black"><p>Racing a racing drone in a competition is very fun especially with mates. The funny thing is that me and my mates are the best in the country at racing this is funny as we pretty much lap people during races which leads to good banter. Although me and my friends have also seen bad things at races like when I hit someone’s quad out of the sky flying at about 95kmh and destroyed it! we tried to tell him it was all part of the fun but none the less he didn’t agree with us. The photo below shows how the props (propellers) shatter and are very dangerous when they hit something. </p> <p/></center>
